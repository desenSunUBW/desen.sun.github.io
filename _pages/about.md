Welcome! I am a researcher at the **University of Waterloo** (UWaterloo), where I pursue my passion for advancing the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **efficient and secure diffusion models**. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of producing high-quality images, text, and other complex data distributions. However, their widespread adoption faces significant challenges in terms of computational efficiency and security vulnerabilities.

### Efficient Diffusion Models
I work on developing novel techniques to improve the efficiency of diffusion models, including:
- **Accelerated sampling algorithms** that reduce the number of diffusion steps required for generation
- **Model compression and distillation** methods to create lighter, faster variants without sacrificing quality
- **Architectural optimizations** that enable real-time generation on resource-constrained devices

### Secure Diffusion Models
Security is a critical concern for diffusion models, especially as they become integrated into production systems. My research addresses:
- **Privacy-preserving training** mechanisms to protect sensitive training data
- **Robustness against adversarial attacks** that could compromise model integrity
- **Secure inference protocols** that prevent unauthorized access or model extraction
- **Fairness and bias mitigation** in diffusion model outputs
