Welcome! I am a PhD student at the **University of Waterloo**, where I pursue my passion for advancing the field of machine learning systems supervised by [Prof Sihang Liu](https://www.sihangliu.com/). I got my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2020, and my Master of Science (M.S.) degree from Beihang University, working with Prof Yuebin Bai. 

## Research Interests

My research interest is broad, including using **system and archtect** methods to optimize the **Machine Learning** applications at both **performance and security** angle. During my PhD career, I typically focus on Diffusion models, which have emerged as powerful generative models capable of producing high-quality images, videos, text, and other complex data distributions.
